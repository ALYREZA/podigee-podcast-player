# Podigee Podcast Player

This is a work in progress web player intended for playing podcasts or other rich audio formats (audio enriched with metadata like chapter marks, etc.).

## Current state

The player is currently in alpha state, which means it has not been tested extensively in a wide range of browsers and might be lacking some features necessary for production use.

## Who
